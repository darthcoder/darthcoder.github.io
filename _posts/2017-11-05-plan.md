For sometime now I have been chasing the idea of becoming a machine learning expert. In pursuing this goal, the most that I have managed to do is that I have managed to read the introduction and first chapter of the Calculus book by Apostol. I did solve some of the problems, but I cannot shake the feeling that it is a horrible way to progress esp because it is taking too goddamn long in this way.

I talked to Nafey and he suggested that I should learn Javascript. Well okay then, I have been considering Javascript for some time now.

[This](https://github.com/P1xt/p1xt-guides/blob/master/wd-cs.md) is the guide that I intend to follow. It will take some time. It has crazy projects like Clone Reddit, Clone Twitter and so on. Lets see how much of it I manage to complete.
