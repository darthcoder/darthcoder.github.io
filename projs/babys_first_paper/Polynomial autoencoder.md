The most direct way to compress an embedding (other than quantization) is to fit PCA on the corpus and keep the top-d eigenvectors. It works, but PCA is a linear projection, and neural-network embeddings on the sphere are structurally nonlinear — the well-known **cone effect** in transformers. Some of the variance lives in a nonlinear tail that a linear decoder can’t reach.

This post is about a closed-form way to add a **quadratic** decoder on top of PCA, to capture part of that nonlinear tail. The encoder stays as plain PCA. The decoder is a degree-2 polynomial lift plus Ridge OLS (ordinary linear regression with L2 regularization), also closed-form. No SGD, no epochs, no hyperparameter search. One `np.linalg.solve` over corpus statistics.

The construction itself isn’t mine. “PCA encoder + quadratic decoder + least-squares fit” appears in the dynamical-systems literature under the name **quadratic manifold** (see [Jain 2017](https://arxiv.org/abs/1610.09902), [Geelen-Willcox 2022](https://arxiv.org/abs/2205.02304) / [2023](https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.13748), [Schwerdtner-Peherstorfer 2024+](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.06732) — more in [§9](#9-where-the-method-came-from-and-where-its-already-used)). I only stumbled onto these papers after running my experiments and believing the construction was new. The polynomial lift doesn’t come up much in modern ML conversations, and this post is a note about a useful trick from an adjacent discipline carrying over to retrieval.

The concrete result. BEIR/FiQA, `mxbai-embed-large-v1` (1024d), per-vector budget 512 bytes. Metric is **NDCG@10** (Normalized Discounted Cumulative Gain over the top-10, the standard retrieval ranking-quality measure; range \[0, 1\], higher is better):

| method | NDCG@10 | Δ vs raw 1024d |
| --- | --- | --- |
| raw 1024d (4096 bytes) | 0.4525 | — |
| PCA top-256 | 0.4168 | \-3.58 p.p. |
| **poly-AE 256d** | **0.4441** | **\-0.85 p.p.** |
| matryoshka top-256 | 0.4039 | \-4.86 p.p. |

PCA already gives 4× per-vector memory compression at -3.58 p.p. NDCG. A quadratic decoder on top of PCA pulls another **+2.73 p.p.** — closing almost the entire gap to raw, at the same byte budget. Matryoshka is in the table as another familiar baseline (here it drops more than PCA — a known side observation, not the central claim of this post; see [§3](#3-the-headline-table--four-models) footnote and [§4](#4-where-the-quadratic-decoder-actually-helps)).

Measured on four models (nomic-v1.5, mxbai-large, bge-base, e5-base). Poly-AE over PCA: +1 to +4.4 p.p. at d=128, +0.03 to +2.7 p.p. at d=256. Full table in [§3](#3-the-headline-table--four-models).

Full implementation — ~150 lines of numpy, MIT, repository [github.com/IvanPleshkov/poly-autoencoder](https://github.com/IvanPleshkov/poly-autoencoder). The BEIR eval script is `beir_eval.py` in the same repo. Reproduces in 30–40 minutes on an M-series MacBook (10–15 min to encode the corpus, ~15 min for the Ridge solve at d=256).

**Contents:**

## 1\. What we’re comparing

Four lines in every measurement:

- **raw** — the full embedding, no compression. Quality ceiling and the most bytes per vector. The “expensive” baseline that gives a fair ceiling.
- **matryoshka** — `embedding[:d]` plus L2 normalization. On models trained with a matryoshka loss (nomic, mxbai in our sample), this is a valid matryoshka vector. On models without matryoshka training (bge-base, e5-base) it’s a test of what happens when you naively slice a non-MRL model — the scenario users of the bge family, e5, and custom-fine-tuned embeddings actually fall into.
- **PCA** — top-d eigenvectors of the corpus covariance. Vectors live in d-dimensional PCA coordinates.
- **poly-AE** — our method. Encode with PCA into `p ∈ ℝ^d`, decode with a quadratic polynomial back to a full D-dimensional `V̂`, retrieve on `V̂`.

At a fixed `d`, all four methods store `2d` bytes per vector (fp16 coordinates).

## 2\. Experimental setup

BEIR is the standard set of retrieval datasets (SciFact, FiQA, NFCorpus, TREC-COVID, etc.). The metric is NDCG@10. Corpus and queries are encoded with the chosen model, top-10 are retrieved by cosine similarity, and NDCG is computed against the labeled qrels.

PCA and poly-AE are fit **transductively**: statistics are computed on the corpus we want to compress. Queries never participate in the fit — they hit a fixed encoder/decoder at inference time. This matches a production deployment: an index operator computes PCA + Ridge once on their data and then serves queries.

For the main runs we use **FiQA** — 57K documents, 648 queries, 1706 qrels.

## 3\. The headline table — four models

NDCG@10 on FiQA at budgets of 256 fp16 (512 bytes/vector) and 128 fp16 (256 bytes):

| Model | D | d | raw | matryoshka† | PCA | **poly-AE** | poly over matryoshka | poly vs raw |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| nomic-embed-text-v1.5 | 768 | 128 | 0.3746 | 0.3190 | 0.3273 | **0.3380** | +1.90 p.p. | \-3.65 p.p. |
| nomic-embed-text-v1.5 | 768 | 256 | 0.3746 | 0.3508 | 0.3670 | **0.3673** | +1.65 p.p. | \-0.73 p.p. |
| mxbai-embed-large-v1 | 1024 | 128 | 0.4525 | 0.3503 | 0.3689 | **0.4129** | +6.26 p.p. | \-3.97 p.p. |
| mxbai-embed-large-v1 | 1024 | 256 | 0.4525 | 0.4039 | 0.4168 | **0.4441** | +4.02 p.p. | \-0.85 p.p. |
| bge-base-en-v1.5\* | 768 | 128 | 0.4062 | 0.2914 | 0.3266 | **0.3654** | +7.40 p.p. | \-4.09 p.p. |
| bge-base-en-v1.5\* | 768 | 256 | 0.4062 | 0.3574 | 0.3688 | **0.3958** | +3.84 p.p. | \-1.05 p.p. |
| e5-base-v2\* | 768 | 128 | 0.3987 | 0.2498 | 0.3065 | **0.3317** | +8.18 p.p. | \-6.70 p.p. |
| e5-base-v2\* | 768 | 256 | 0.3987 | 0.3333 | 0.3618 | **0.3852** | +5.19 p.p. | \-1.35 p.p. |

† The “matryoshka” column is `embedding[:d]` plus L2 normalization. On nomic and mxbai it’s a valid matryoshka vector. On models marked with `*` (bge-base, e5-base) the model wasn’t trained for matryoshka, and the slice here is a test of what happens when you naively slice a non-MRL model. This is the scenario that users of the bge family, e5, and custom-fine-tuned embeddings actually fall into — and we measure it here honestly.

What this shows:

1. **Poly-AE is consistently ahead of PCA** across all four models. Lift: +1 to +4.4 p.p. NDCG at d=128, +0.03 to +2.7 p.p. at d=256. Where the quadratic decoder actually helps and at what `d` — discussed in [§4](#4-where-the-quadratic-decoder-actually-helps).
2. **At `d=256`, poly-AE loses 0.7–1.4 p.p. NDCG vs raw 768/1024** on all four models. 4× per-vector memory compression for less than 1.5 p.p. lost — the main number of the post.
3. **On non-matryoshka-trained models, the matryoshka column drops more than PCA** — up to -15 p.p. NDCG at d=128. This is a side observation: the post compares PCA and poly-AE, not PCA vs matryoshka. If the matryoshka numbers in the table look surprising, there’s a short pointer in [§4](#4-where-the-quadratic-decoder-actually-helps).

## 4\. Where the quadratic decoder actually helps

PCA is the linear baseline. The quadratic decoder adds the nonlinear piece that the linear one can’t reach (mechanics in [§5](#5-why-a-linear-projection-loses-information)). How much does that actually help on retrieval, and at what `d`?

Poly-AE lift over PCA, by model and `d`:

| Model | poly over PCA, d=128 | poly over PCA, d=256 |
| --- | --- | --- |
| nomic-v1.5 | +1.07 p.p. | +0.03 p.p. |
| mxbai-large | +4.40 p.p. | +2.73 p.p. |
| bge-base | +3.88 p.p. | +2.70 p.p. |
| e5-base-v2 | +2.52 p.p. | +2.34 p.p. |

The picture:

1. **At d=128 (8× compression) poly is consistently 1–4 p.p. ahead of PCA.** This is the regime where the linear decoder starts dropping noticeable variance into the nonlinear tail, and the quadratic correction pulls it back. Sweet spot for the method.
2. **At d=256 (4× compression) the gap is uneven.** On mxbai/bge/e5 — a stable +2.3–2.7 p.p. On nomic — close to zero (+0.03). Likely reason: nomic was carefully trained with multi-slice contrastive loss, its latent is more isotropic, and at d=256 the linear projection already takes most of what’s there. On non-MRL models the nonlinear tail is bigger → poly helps more.
3. **More anisotropy → bigger lift.** The stronger the cone effect, the more variance lives in the nonlinear tail that PCA can’t reach but poly can. That’s the geometry [§5](#5-why-a-linear-projection-loses-information) unpacks.

### Side: where matryoshka sits in the table

In [§3](#3-the-headline-table--four-models) you can see that on non-MRL models (bge, e5) the matryoshka column drops more than PCA — i.e. on a random non-MRL-trained model, naive slicing works worse than a corpus-side linear projection. This is a known result; the “MRL vs PCA on retrieval” question has been discussed independently of this post — see [Matryoshka-Adaptor 2024](https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20243), [SMEC “Rethinking MRL” 2025](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12474), [CoRECT 2025](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19340), and the YouTube video literally titled [«Is PCA enough?»](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lklw59jQRKE). This post compares PCA and poly-AE; matryoshka is in the [§3](#3-the-headline-table--four-models) table as a third reference point.

### Where poly-AE doesn’t apply

A corpus-side PCA fit is a required part of the method. That means poly-AE **doesn’t work** when the corpus isn’t available:

- **multi-tenant SaaS**: one model, thousands of clients with different corpora — fitting PCA per client is operational pain;
- **streaming indices**: statistics drift over time, PCA needs periodic refits;
- **edge inference**: phone, browser, embedded — you don’t want to ship a per-client PCA matrix alongside the model.

In those settings you want an MRL-trained model and `embedding[:d]`, and poly-AE isn’t an alternative — it also needs corpus statistics.

### Practical takeaway

In the operator-fit setting (fixed corpus, the operator fits compression once), you have two working modes:

- **d=256** gives 4× compression at -0.7 to -1.4 p.p. NDCG vs raw. Poly over PCA: from +0.03 (nomic) to +2.7 p.p. (mxbai/bge/e5). On an MRL-trained model like nomic the gap to PCA is minimal; on non-MRL models poly is clearly ahead.
- **d=128** gives 8× compression. Poly over PCA: +1 to +4.4 p.p. on any model. Sweet spot for the method.

## 5\. Why a linear projection loses information

PCA is the best possible **linear** projection of data into a d-dimensional subspace. But “best linear” doesn’t mean “good enough”: if the data has nonlinear structure, a linear decoder can’t reach it, period.

Transformer embeddings have such structure, well-studied — the **cone effect**. The point cloud is concentrated inside a narrow cone on the unit sphere and is heavily nonlinearly structured inside that cone.

Left: isotropic data. Right: one example of what anisotropic data can look like.

drag to rotate

PCA only catches projections along orthogonal eigenvectors — i.e. the linear ellipsoid that the cloud doesn’t actually fit in. Whatever lives in the curvature of the manifold is structurally invisible to a linear decoder. The stronger the anisotropy (the narrower the cone), the more variance sits in this nonlinear tail that PCA structurally can’t reach.

So what we want is clear. A decoder that can deal in **quadratic combinations of coordinates** — i.e. a decoder that captures local curvature of the manifold. Then we’d recover some of the information that PCA loses.

## 6\. A polynomial decoder via a linear lift

[§5](#5-why-a-linear-projection-loses-information) made it clear that we need a nonlinear decoder. The straightforward route is to train a neural network. But then we lose the closed-form pipeline: SGD, learning rate, batch size, convergence, early stopping. We’d like a nonlinear decoder solvable by a single formula.

Standard regression trick: the **polynomial lift**. Take vector `p` and lift it into all monomials up to degree 2 — bias, linear terms, squares, and pairwise products. On a 2D example:

```plaintext
lift([p₁, p₂]) = [1,   p₁, p₂,   p₁², p₁·p₂, p₂²]
                  ↑    ↑   ↑     ↑    ↑      ↑
                bias  linear     quadratic
```

Any linear combination of these six = a quadratic function of the original `p₁, p₂`. So **a linear regression on the lift = a quadratic regression in the original space**. No nonlinear optimization needed, plain Ridge OLS in closed form does it.

Apply this to our case. The encoder is top-d PCA (`p = (V − V̄) @ Q`, `p ∈ ℝ^d`). Lift `p` into all monomials up to degree 2:

```python
def polynomial_lift(p, degree=2):
    features = [1.0]                              # bias
    features.extend(p)                            # degree 1
    for i in range(len(p)):
        for j in range(i, len(p)):
            features.append(p[i] * p[j])          # degree 2
    return np.array(features)
```

The lift dimension is `M = (d+1)(d+2)/2`. For `d=128` that’s `M = 8385`, for `d=256` it’s `M = 33153`. The decoder is a linear regression from the M-dimensional lift back to the D-dimensional original. Despite being “just a linear regression”, the resulting map `p → V̂` is quadratic — exactly what we needed.

Training the decoder is one `np.linalg.solve`:

```python
def fit_decoder(P, V, lam=1e-3):
    L = polynomial_lift(P, degree=2)               # (N, M)
    G = L.T @ L + lam * np.trace(L.T @ L) / L.shape[1] * np.eye(L.shape[1])
    W = np.linalg.solve(G, L.T @ V)
    return W
```

The polynomial autoencoder is assembled:

![Polynomial autoencoder schema: V → PCA → p → poly lift → L → Ridge OLS → V̂; V − V̂ → V_resid](https://ivanpleshkov.dev/blog/polynomial-autoencoder/images/ae_schema_en_light.svg)

Polynomial autoencoder schema: V → PCA → p → poly lift → L → Ridge OLS → V̂; V − V̂ → V\_resid

- **encoder** — closed-form linear (PCA), no training,
- **decoder** — closed-form quadratic (Ridge OLS on the polynomial lift), trained with one `np.linalg.solve`,
- **reconstruction** — `V̂ = polynomial_lift(p) @ W`,
- **residual** — `V_resid = V − V̂` (useful in [§8](#8-compression--what-to-do-with-the-residual) for quantization).

No backprop, learning rate, batch size, epochs. On 100K vectors at d=100, a couple of minutes on CPU. At d=256, around 15 minutes (Ridge solves an `M³` system, cubic in `M`).

### One technical note on normalization

Raw `p` after PCA has huge anisotropy across its coordinates (the first axis ~50× the variance of the last) — bad for Ridge: large axes dominate the solution, small ones get under-weighted. Fix is per-axis std normalization:

```python
p_normed = p / np.sqrt(eigvals)
p = p_normed * (0.9 / np.linalg.norm(p_normed, axis=1).max())
```

The global `0.9 / max-norm` factor gives `‖p‖ ≤ 0.9` — numerical stability under squaring. Doesn’t affect NDCG, but cleaner numerically.

## 7\. The small-corpus measurement and in-sample magic

A methodological note. On the first sanity check on SciFact (5183 docs, 300 queries), poly-AE at `d=256` showed NDCG@10 **0.6980** vs raw **0.7032** — losing only 0.5 p.p. The reported gain over PCA there was +1.36 p.p.

On FiQA (57638 docs), the same experiment gave:

- poly vs raw: -0.73 p.p. (stable, like SciFact);
- **poly over PCA: +0.03 p.p.** (down from +1.36 on SciFact).

What happened. On SciFact at `d=256` Ridge solves a regression with **M=33153 features on N=5183 vectors** — severely overdetermined: the in-sample `V̂_corpus` matches `V_corpus` almost exactly, so retrieval on `V̂_corpus` is equivalent to retrieval on the full 768-d `V_corpus`. The SciFact poly-AE measurement inflated its gap with PCA because it **memorized the corpus** in the Ridge weights, not because it generalized better.

What’s important: the poly-vs- **raw** drop is stable (-0.5 to -0.85 p.p.) across both corpora. But for poly-vs-PCA, on small corpora (`N ≤ 10K` at `d=256`) the gap is partly mythical. A safe rule of thumb: `N` should be at least 5–10× larger than `M = (d+1)(d+2)/2`. For `d=256` that’s `N ≳ 200K`. For `d=128` it’s `N ≳ 50K`.

In the headline table ([§3](#3-the-headline-table--four-models)), FiQA’s `N = 57K` is enough for `d=128` and borderline for `d=256`. The bge numbers on FiQA at `d=256` should be read with that caveat.

## 8\. Compression — what to do with the residual

The autoencoder doesn’t compress anything by itself, strictly speaking. It repackages a vector into a pair `(p, V_resid)` — latent code plus residual. Same information, different shape. To get actual compression, the residual has to be quantized.

This is where poly-AE’s anisotropy-removing property matters. On DBpedia-OpenAI at `d=100`, `cond(V_resid)` drops from 72 to 3.4 — almost isotropic residual. Linear PCA at the same `d` gives `cond=4.21` — noticeably less isotropic.

Google Research recently published [**TurboQuant**](https://research.google/blog/turboquant-redefining-ai-efficiency-with-extreme-compression/) — a quantizer with a fixed random rotation that **on isotropic distributions gets close to the theoretical compression limit** (Shannon rate-distortion for normals). The composition is natural: the autoencoder strips out the anisotropy, TurboQuant efficiently quantizes the now-isotropic residual.

```plaintext
V  ──►  encoder (PCA)  ──►  p
        │
        decoder (poly+Ridge)  ──►  V̂
        │
V  −  V̂  ──►  V_resid  ──►  TurboQuant  ──►  compact code
```

For Qdrant 1.18 I shipped a TurboQuant modification with anisotropy compensation. It achieves roughly the same recall as the “poly-AE + residual quantization” hybrid, but without needing to store the poly-AE latent coordinates — saving the p-side of the per-vector byte budget. The tricks I layered on top of standard TurboQuant will be in a separate post.

## 9\. Where the method came from and where it’s already used

I’ve been familiar with the polynomial lift since my time at [ACD/Labs](https://www.acdlabs.com/) — in cheminformatics it’s a standard tool for building features from molecular structure (as input for downstream regression). Currently I work at Qdrant. When I was implementing late-interaction retrieval support there ([ColBERT-style multi-vectors with maxsim, v1.10](https://github.com/qdrant/qdrant/releases/tag/v1.10.0)), I remembered the trick — and that’s how the “PCA + quadratic decoder” idea came together. I thought no one had tried it for neural embeddings yet.

When the draft went to [Sava Kalbachou](https://www.linkedin.com/in/sava-kalbachou/) for review, he pointed out specific papers where this exact construction has long been used — in numerical modeling of physical systems, under the name **quadratic manifold**:

- **Jain, Tiso, Rixen, Rutzmoser 2017** — [«A quadratic manifold for model order reduction of nonlinear structural dynamics»](https://arxiv.org/abs/1610.09902). Introduces the concept: PCA top-d plus a quadratic correction. The quadratic part is derived from the physics of the system, not from a data fit. The earliest paper.
- **Geelen, Wright, Willcox 2022** — [«Operator inference for non-intrusive model reduction with quadratic manifolds»](https://arxiv.org/abs/2205.02304). **Exactly our construction**: PCA encoder, decoder on the Kronecker product of the latent code, coefficients fit via regularized least squares. [Open-source code](https://github.com/geelenr/quad_manifold).
- **Geelen, Balzano, Willcox 2023** — [«Learning latent representations in high-dimensional state spaces using polynomial manifold constructions»](https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.13748). Explicitly named “polynomial manifold”, explicitly fit by regression.
- **Schwerdtner, Peherstorfer 2024–2025** — a series of follow-ups exploring training and application variants: [greedy direction selection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.06732), [sparse regression on the manifold](https://doi.org/10.1137/24M1717270), [streaming online learning](https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/10.1098/rspa.2024.0670), and [«Operator Inference Aware Quadratic Manifolds with Isotropic Reduced Coordinates»](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20463) — the last one curiously echoes the residual-isotropy story we use for TurboQuant in [§8](#8-compression--what-to-do-with-the-residual).

In those papers the construction is applied to solution-trajectory snapshots of physical-system simulations. Embeddings are a different data geometry, and it’s not obvious in advance that quadratic manifold should also work there; the numbers in [§3](#3-the-headline-table--four-models) show that it does.

### Why this combination doesn’t seem to be in mainstream ML

These are just speculations. The communities probably don’t overlap much: quadratic-manifold work appears in engineering journals and rarely surfaces in ML research.

Also, in ML’s collective memory polynomial methods are mostly associated with the kernel trick (SVM, kernel PCA) — a different construction, and the explicit polynomial lift as a stand-alone technique rarely comes up after that.

And an “autoencoder” is usually reflexively understood as a neural network in modern ML; closed-form variants may simply fall outside the usual field of attention.

So this is an applied-ML post: a technique developed in an adjacent field turns out to be useful for embeddings as well. The contribution of the post is the port and the empirical check.

## 10\. Limits of the method

A few honest caveats:

- **Cubic Ridge solve.** At `d=256`, `M = 33K`, and `np.linalg.solve` in closed form costs `O(M³)` ≈ 5–15 minutes on CPU. At `d=384` that’s already `M = 74K` and `M³` is unmanageable. The method is comfortable up to `d ≈ 200–256`. For larger `d` you’d need randomized methods (random feature approximation), or move to a neural decoder.
- **Transductive fit.** PCA + Ridge are computed on the corpus we intend to compress. If the corpus drifts over time, decompression degrades. Fine for static indices, problematic for streaming.
- **Small N.** When `N < 5M` (i.e. `N < 200K` at `d=256`), Ridge starts memorizing the corpus, in-sample retrieval improves due to overfitting rather than due to structure. The signal: a poly-vs-PCA gap that’s too large probably means overfit.
- **Degree 3 doesn’t work yet.** A degree-3 lift gives `M = O(d³)` — for `d=100` that’s 175K features. Fits in memory, but the Ridge solve is impractical and overfitting climbs.

## 11\. What to try next

Obvious branches:

- **Bigger corpora, heavier models.** All measurements in the post are on FiQA with models in the 305–560M-param range. Worth running on MS MARCO (8.8M passages) with e5-mistral-7b-class models. The cubic Ridge becomes the bottleneck — you’d need random-feature approximation.
- **Lift degree.** At what `d/N` does degree 3 start to actually help? Are there embeddings with significant 3rd-order tensor structure that we’re losing now?
- **The regime where you can’t compute matryoshka.** Multi-tenant SaaS, edge inference — there poly-AE without PCA won’t work either (it needs corpus stats). But a **hybrid**: matryoshka in the model + polynomial decoder on the client — should give the best of both worlds.

## Code and reproduction

Loaders for BEIR (SciFact, FiQA, NFCorpus, TREC-COVID), encoders (nomic-v1.5, mxbai-large, bge-base, e5-base), PCA-init with per-axis std, polynomial lift, Ridge OLS, retrieval with NDCG@10/Recall@10 — all in [github.com/IvanPleshkov/poly-autoencoder](https://github.com/IvanPleshkov/poly-autoencoder).

Minimal run:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/IvanPleshkov/poly-autoencoder.git
cd poly-autoencoder
python -m venv .venv && source .venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt pytrec_eval einops
python beir_eval.py --model nomic-embed-text-v1.5 --dataset fiqa --d 128,256
```

On an M-series MacBook the first run downloads the model and dataset, encodes the corpus (5–15 min depending on the model), and over the next 5–20 minutes prints a table with NDCG@10 for all four methods.
